== Description ==

=THIS PLUGIN IS ONLY USEFUL IF YOU'RE USING MULTI-SITE MODE=

This is the same plugin previously available at [http://firestats.cc/wiki/WPMUPluginCommander](http://firestats.cc/wiki/WPMUPluginCommander), which has been used reliably with wordpress multi-site networks for many years.

Plugin Commander is a plugin management plugin for multi-site mode, which allows further control on network-activated plugins.

It allow you to do the following things:

* Mark any plugin in the plugins directory to be automatically activated for new blogs.
* Mass activate or deactivate a plugin for all existing blogs
* Choose which plugins users can activate and deactivate through Manage->Plugins, for this to make sense you need to disable the built-in plugins menu (through Site Admin->Options->Menus)
* Activate and deactivate plugins for specific blogs, even if the blog owner is not allowed to control those plugins.
